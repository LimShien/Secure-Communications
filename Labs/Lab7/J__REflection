1. Why might increasing the number of iterations be a bette
r method of protecting
a hashed password than using a salted version?
    -  increasing the number of iteration doubles the time for hashing,
         thus, slow down any brute force cracking


2. Why might the methods bcrypt, Phpass and PBFDK2 be preferred for storing
passwords than MD5, SHA?
    MD5 and SHa can be be cracked with rainbow table/ brute force attack
