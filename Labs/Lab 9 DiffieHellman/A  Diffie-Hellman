A Diffie-Hellman
    1   Bob and Alice have agreed on the values:
        g=2879, N= 9929
        Bob Select x=6, Alice selects y=9

        Now calculate (using a calculator):
        Bob’s A value (g**x mod N): 4850
        Alice’s B value (g**Y mod N): 3614

    2   Now they exchange the values. Next calculate the
        shared key:
        Bob’s value (B**x mod N):4868
        Alice’s value (A**Y mod N): 4868
        Do they match? [Yes] [No]
B OpenSSL(Diffie-Helman and ECC)
    1   Generate 768-bit Diffie-Hellman parameters:
        openssl dhparam -out dhparams.pem
        768 -text
        View your key with:
        cat dhparams.pem

        How many bits does the prime number have? 768

        How long does it take to produce the
        parameters for 1,024 bits (Group 2)?  
        How long does it take to produce the
        parameters for 1536 bits (Group 5)?
        How would we change the g value?

    2   Let’s look at the Elliptic curves we can
        create:
        openssl ecparam -list_curves
        We can create our elliptic parameter file
        with:
        openssl ecparam -name
        secp256k1 -out secp256k1.pem
        Now view the details with:
        openssl ecparam -in
        secp256k1.pem -text -param_enc
        explicit -noout
        What are the details of the key?
        Now we can create our key pair:
        openssl ecparam -in
        secp256k1.pem -genkey -noout - out mykey.pem


        Name three 160-bit curves:
            c2pnb163v1
            c2pnb163v2
            c2pnb163v3
            wap-wsg-idm-ecid-wtls7
        By doing a search on the Internet, which
        curve does Bitcoin use?
            secp256k1
        Can you find other application around that use
        this curve or others?
        Can you explain how you would use these EC
        parameters to perform the ECDH key
        exchange?
