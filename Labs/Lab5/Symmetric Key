A2  openssl prime -hex 1111

        42 Not prime 
        1431 prime
A3  Now create a file named myfile.txt (either useNotepad or another editor).Nextencrypt with aes-256-cbc 
    openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -in myfile.txt -out encrypted.bin

A4  Now repeat the previous command and add the –base64 option.openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -in myfile.txt -out encrypted.bin–base64
    openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -in myfile.txt -out encrypted.bin -base64
A5  Now Repeat the previous command and observe the encrypted output
    it has changed.
A6  Now let’s decrypt the encrypted file with the correct format:
openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -in encrypted.bin -pass pass:napier-base64



Padding AES                              

B1  With AESwhich uses a 256-bit key, what is the normalblock size (in bytes).
    Block size = 2
    hex character = 32

B2  Go to:&Web link(AES Padding):http://asecuritysite.com/encryption/paddingUsing 256-bit AES encryption, and a message of “kettle” and a password of “oxtail”, determine the cipher using the differing padding methods (you only need to show the first six hex characters).If you like, copy and paste the Python code from the page, and run it on your Kali instance
    CMS:61e145c4936c
    Null:61e14593c46c
    Space:61e14593c46c

B3  For the following words, estimate how many hex
    characters will be used for the 256-bit AES
    encryption:
    fox:29
    foxtrot:25
    foxtrotanteater:17

C   Padding(DES)

C1  With DES which uses a 64-bit key, what is the
    normal block size (in bytes):
    Block size (bytes):8
    Number of hex characters for
    block size:16

C2  Using 64-bit DES key encryption, and a
    message of “kettle” and a password of “oxtail”,
    determine the cipher using the differing
    padding methods.

C3 3 For the following words, estimate how many
    hex characters will be used for the 64-bit key
    DES encryption:
    fox:5
    foxtrot:1
    foxtrotanteater:1


Now determine the cipher text for the following (the first example has already been
completed):

message     key            CMS cipher
“hello”     “hello123”      0a7ec77951291795bac6690c9e7f4c0d
“inkwell”   “orange”        484299ceec1ad83b1ce848b0a9733c8d

“security”  “qwerty”        6be35165e2c9a624de4f401692fe7161

“Africa”    “changeme”      c283f9cf046e82aa6e03b9b91e19b244
