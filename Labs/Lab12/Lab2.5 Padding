A  Padding(AES)
    1. With AES which uses a 256-bit key, what is the normal block size (in bytes).

    Block size (bytes): 32 bytes
    Number of hex characters for block size: 64

    2. Go to:http://asecuritysite.com/encryption/paddingUsing 256-bit AES encryption, and a message of “kettle” and a password of “oxtail”, determine the cipher using the differing padding methods(you only need to show the first six hex characters).

    CMS: 61e145
    Bit: 61e145
    ZeroLength: 61e145
    Null: 61e145 
    Space: 18eff3
    Random:61e145

    3. For the following words, estimate how many hex characters will be used for the 256-bit AES encryption:
        Number of hex characters:
        “fox”: 29
        “foxtrot”: 25
        “foxtrotanteater”: 17
        “foxtrotanteatercastle”:11
    4. With 256-bit AES, for ncharacters in a string, how would you generalise the calculation of the number of hex characters in the cipher text
      How many Base-64 characters would be used (remember 6 bits are used to represent a Base-64 character)

        Hex character: 32-n
        Base-64 characters: (32 - n ) * 8 / 6

    B. Padding DES
       1 With DES which uses a 64-bit key, what is the normal block size (inbytes)

        block size(bytes) : 8
        Number of hex characters for block size:16

        2.Using 64-bit DES encryption, and a message of “kettle” and a password of “oxtail”, determine the cipher using the differing padding methods

            CMS: 0d74d0510d32caaa
            Bit: 0d74d0510d32caaa
            ZeroLength: 0d74d0510d32caaa
            Null: 0d74d0510d32caaa 
            Space: 8400ede37908c60c
            Random:0d74d0510d32caaa

    c. For the following words, estimate how many hex characters will be used for the 64-bit DES encryption

            “fox”: 10
            “foxtrot”: 2
            “foxtrotanteater”: 2
            “foxtrotanteatercastle”:6

    d.
    With 64-bit DES, for ncharacters in a string, how would you generalise the calculation of the number of hex characters in the cipher text.How many Base-64 characters wouldbe used (remember 6 bits are used to represent a Base-64 character)

    Hex character = (8 - n) * 2, n < 8

    B64: (16 - 2n)* 6/8
